### Question 1: Fibonacci Sequence

The task is to implement a program that allows a user to ask for an input number and then print the Fibonacci sequence up to that number.

The program allows the user to input a positive integer and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to that number. The code is modular, includes error handling, and follows best practices for logging.

### Question 2: Largest Difference

Task is to implement a Java function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the largest difference between any two numbers in the list.

The function uses a straightforward iterative approach to find the largest difference between any two numbers in the input list. It includes error handling and efficiently calculates the largest difference with a time complexity of O(n).

### Question 3: SQL Query for Employee Selection

The task is to write an SQL query to select all employees whose age is above 30 and salary is above $50,000. The requirements include writing the SQL query that satisfies the given conditions, optimizing the query for performance, ensuring clarity and readability, and demonstrating a good understanding of SQL syntax and concepts.

The query uses the `SELECT` statement with a `WHERE` clause to filter employees based on age and salary conditions.

### Question 4: Data Type Conversion

The code is intended to calculate the average of a list of numbers. However, there is an issue related to data type conversion, leading to an unexpected output.

The `total` variable is of type `int`, and the division with `numbers.length` also being an `int` truncates the result. To fix the code, explicitly converting the `total` variable to `double` before performing the division to retain the decimal part of the result.
